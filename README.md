# Museum of Self
This is a preliminary interface for our Beyond Bits and Atoms final project. 
It uses React Native to implement two of three actions in
Museum of Self, a "personal media" app in which users can upload or "capture"
artifacts, "curate" exhibits around identity categories, and then "showcase"
their museum.
